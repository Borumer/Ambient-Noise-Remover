/**
 * During the propagate step, a mathematical model is applied over a specified period of time 
 * to predict the next state vector and state covariance matrix of the system. 
 * This mathematical model is known as the state transition matrix, Î¦ or F, 
 * and is used to define how the state vector changes over time.
 * The model must also include noise to account for disturbances and errors in the state prediction.
 * Therefore, the propagate step also includes adjustments by the process noise covariance matrix, Q
 * to define uncertainty in the noise
